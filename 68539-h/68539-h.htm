<p class="ph1">A FANTASY</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="floatright">By MABEL M. MORAN.</span></p>



<p>SCENE: A room in Ann Hathaway’s cottage at Stratford-on-Avon.
Furnishing in keeping with the period.</p>

<p>(As curtain rises Ann is in the act of placing chairs,
benches etc., in a semi-circle around the room; in center of
circle is a long chest to be used as desk for the presiding
officer.</p>

<p>Noise is heard at door. Ann runs and opens same.
Enter Mistress Page and Mistress Ford,—with animated flutter).</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>ANN: Mistress Page (kisses) and Mistress Ford (more
kisses). No finer sight ere greeted eye than you two
dear ladies—nor never did I need you more.</p>

<p>PAGE: How now?</p>

<p>FORD: And why is this?</p>

<p>ANN: Forsooth, ’tis a meeting here to-day of the Shakespeare
Garden Club—and like to be grave and solemn, so
none better than you Merry Wives of Windsor to cheer
me up.</p>

<p>PAGE: A meeting—a-lack-a-day—may we stay? We are
not members.</p>

<p>ANN: Oh, you are my guests—and most welcome.</p>

<p>FORD: Do we know the ladies?</p>

<p>ANN: Nearly all, I trow, there’s the President, Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>PAGE: She was ever all dignity—and ambition.</p>

<p>ANN: And the Secretary is Portia, the attorney-at-law.</p>

<p>FORD: A-la-la, she’ll make you toe the mark.</p>

<p>ANN: Jessica, Shylock’s daughter, is Treasurer.</p>

<p>PAGE: No one dares owe dues to her, I’ll warrant.</p>

<p>ANN: But sit you down, and have a merry gossip together.
Methinks the ladies do arrive.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Knock on door. Perdita enters, greeting and handshaking)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>ANN: (Aside to wives as Perdita crosses stage and takes
chair at end) You remember the Winters’ Tale they
told of her? (Wives nod energetically)</p>

<p>ANN: And here comes Desdemona, wife of Othello.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Desdemona. (sits by Perdita)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: (aside) How could she ever have married that
horrid black man?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Cordelia.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: I have never met her, she’s daughter to King
Lear, a cranky father and hard to please, but she’s a
lovely religious woman.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="center">Enter Katherine.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: Why that’s Petrucio’s wife, the one they called
the Shrew, she hath an untamed twinkle in her eye.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Jessica.</p>

<p class="center">(sits at table)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: Shylock’s daughter, she keeps him guessing I’ll
warrant.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Rosalind.</p>

<p class="center">(in man’s attire)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That must be Rosalind, she always did love the
doublet and hose, but—as you like it—so do it, say I.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Portia.</p>

<p class="center">(Mortar-board and gown)</p>

<p class="center">(Sits at center table.)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: ’Tis Portia, the lawyer, and most successful. She’ll
win a case tho it be for the Queen or only for a pound
of flesh.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Juliet.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That’s Romeo’s wife, Juliet Capulet that was; for
a run-away match I hear they’re very happy.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Titania.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: There’s a woman I cannot understand. She seems
ever to dwell in a sort of Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Ophelia.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That girl gives me the shivers, tho some say she
makes a fine wife to that melancholy Dane named
Hamlet.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="center">(Regally attired in Egyptian draperies)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: My word! ’Tis well our husbands are not here,
that woman is a vampire.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Enter in numbers minor characters and take
seats, much chatting, laughing, etc., until)</p>

<p class="center">Enter Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p class="center">(All rise and bow, she takes seat at center of
table and raps)</p>

<p class="center">The meeting comes to order.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>LADY MACBETH: (rising and speaking with much dignity)
Ladies of the Shakespeare Garden Club: We
have a long and arduous meeting before us. Do I impose
too much upon the milk of human kindness when
I beg that the minutes of the previous meeting be
omitted?</p>

<p>PORTIA: (Jumping to her feet) I do protest, Madam,
there is no power in Stratford that can alter a decree
established.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: How now! Must we listen to the law
again to-day, Portia? Go to—let’s get on!</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Oh well, what were done, when ’tis
done then ’twere well it were done quickly. Madam
Secretary—the minutes.</p>

<p>PORTIA: (reading) The 12th meeting of the Shakespeare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Garden Club was held on March 15th (interruption
from a member) Oh the Ides of March! The Ides
of March. (grows faint and is fanned by companions.)</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: Poor soul, that is Caesar’s wife.</p>

<p>PORTIA: (continues) The meeting was at the home of
Juliet Montague and was addressed by Will Shakespeare
himself, who hath told us in strong words of the
unsightly condition of the banks of the River Avon.
Willow trees uprooted, old rushes strewn about; broken
flagons, and stray odds and ends of all unsavory things,
even unto defunct felines, lie on the edge of our lovely
waterway, and it was urged by our most beloved
leader that this Club take the matter in hand and clear
away the filth and grow Plants, Flowers and Fruits
along the river’s banks. ’Twas moved by Desdemona,
seconded by Rosalind, and carried that our Garden Club
should attend unto this work.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (rising) Enough! Thus thou must
do, if thou’d have it, let us hear what our members
have in mind.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Madam President, there is more to read.</p>

<p>JESSICA: Sit you down, Portia, and let me read my
report upon the ducats in our treasury.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Jessica, thou art indeed thy father’s child.
Shylock ever thought upon the ducats.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, enough of this. Ambition for
our Club is our dear wish. Let’s on with business. Who
hath considered this matter and can name some fair
flowers to carpet Avon’s banks?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(looks about questioningly, a member rises)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="indentleft">Ah Titania!</span></p>

<p>TITANIA: Madam President, my suggestions come from
realms of fairy land as I dream, half-waking, on a bank
where the wild thyme blows; where oxlips and the nodding
violet grows. Quite over canopied with luscious
woodbine, with sweet musk roses, and with eglantine.
I dream of pease blossoms and mustard seed and
canker roses (tho some call them wild) and honeysuckle
and ivy—(which I trow is feminine because it requires
support). I give you dewberries and apricots, and love-in-idleness,
and there is cupid’s flower and Dian’s bud,
which is but an herb, but brewed will keep men and
women chaste.</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Best brew some for Cleopatra.</p>

<p>TITANIA: (continues) These, Madam President, are what
I would grow on Avon’s marshy banks. (sits down)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Titania hath named a worthy list, let
all in favor signify in the usual way.</p>

<p class="center">(Members applaud and murmur “aye, aye”)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (looking about) Juliet, do I see you
wish to speak?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>JULIET: Madam President, Romeo says the plaintain leaf
is most excellent for healing bruises, why not grow that?
And Friar Lawrence knows many precious juic-ed flowers
that kill the poisons of baleful weeds. Such weeds as
the mandrake that shrieks like living mortals when torn
from the earth. And surely we must have a pomegranate
tree, for Romeo and I both know that the nightingale
loves to sing in the branches, and the nightingale sings
far sweeter than the lark.</p>

<p>JESSICA: Oh you romantic child, still thinking of your
honeymoon.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, your approval? (Applause
and “ayes”)</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (very timidly) Madam President?</p>

<p>KATHERINE: (aside) Have we to listen to Ophelia?
Everyone knows she hath bats in her belfry.</p>

<p>ROSALIND: Hush, Kate, Hamlet hath changed her mind
since they were wed, she’s sane enough now.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Hamlet and Petrucio must be of the same
kin, Petrucio made me change some, forsooth.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (in louder tones) Madam President.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ah Ophelia, speak up my child.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: Madam, I move we plant rosemary, that’s for
remembrance and a chosen emblem for weddings and
funerals. And pansies, they’re for thought, tho Madam
Titania called them “love-in-idleness.” Fennel, too, we
should have, that’s for flatterers, tho some say the gladiators
mixed it with their daily food, to make them fierce
and rude. Columbine is pretty, but it means unfaithfulness—and
forsaken lovers—let’s not plant that. Then
we must have rue, for its other name is herb of grace—we
all need that. And daisies, shall we plant those?
They mean to “dissemble.” But oh dear Madam, I pray
you let us have violets—and violets and violets, for they
mean faithfulness. (sits down)</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Madam President, I move we cheer Ophelia,
she hath told us useful things. (Members—“Aye,
aye, aye!”)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (Raps for quiet) Peace ladies, time
passes, we must hasten, are there more suggestions?</p>

<p>PERDITA: Madam President—Now Jove give me courage,
I do so tremble when I speak—we should plant lavender
and mint, and savory, and marjoram, and pale primroses—fairest
flowers of their season would show star-like
on Avon’s banks, while the flower-de-luce and crown
imperial would rear their lily heads in majesty gainst
the foliage of willows. We could also have carnations
and gillyvors, tho I like them not.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(sits down hastily)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>KATHERINE: Madam President. Perdita is so shy she
will not tell why she likes not the carnation and the
gillyvors, but I know ’tis because they both are streaked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
with red and white and look like painted women.</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Let’s call Cleopatra “gilly” for
short.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Madam President.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Cordelia has the floor.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Ladies, I ask your indulgence while I tell you
a short but sweet tale of the Crown Imperial. This
flower, which we sometimes call the Canterbury Bells,
was first made white and erect and grew to its full beauty
in the Garden of Gethsemane where it was oft noted and
admired by our Lord, but on the night of the Agony, as
he passed through the Garden, all the other flowers
bowed their heads in sorrowful adoration, save the
Crown Imperial, which alone remained with its head
unbowed, but not for long. Sorrow and shame soon
took the place of pride, and tears and painful blushes
followed, and so hath she ever remained with bent
blossoms unto this very day. (Murmurs and nods from
members)</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Did I not say Cordelia was a
fine religious woman?</p>

<p>ROSALINE: Madam President?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Rosaline, my dear, I rejoice to hear
you speak.</p>

<p>ROSALINE: Dear Madam, I recall a sweet song of my
childhood, learned before I knew that sometimes Love’s
Labor’s Lost. It paints a picture of springtime. (Sings)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When daisies pied and violets blue</div>
<div class="verse">And lady-smocks all silver white</div>
<div class="verse">And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue</div>
<div class="verse">Do paint the meadows with delight.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="indentleft">Surely this would apply to Avon’s banks as well.</span></p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Quite likely, child, ’tis a pretty chant,
we thank you. (looks slowly around circle) Ah, Cleopatra,
have you no suggestions?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Cleopatra rises languidly and poses)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>CLEOPATRA: Madam President, age cannot wither, nor
custom stale the infinite variety of my memories of
Egypt’s bounteous blooms; but alas! They would
shrivel and die in your cold clime. Would that you
might see green figs grow, and ripe luscious olives. And
Oh for a glimpse of the date trees on the Nile, or a whiff
of the orange blossoms’ perfume. Could you but
imagine the beauty of the lemon tree heavy with golden
fruit, or the loveliness of the lime. The dusky purple
of Egypt’s wine-like grapes lies ever in mine eye, and I
dream of the wondrous green of the Aspic vine. Yet
perchance that which I love most is the polished sheen
of laurel leaves, for Anthony and I wore laurel chaplets
on our brows throughout the year. (Sinks back into
seat)</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: My word, she treats us English like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
30 farthings.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: My lady Cleopatra hath told us what
we may not have.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (rising hastily) Dear lady, let me tell you
what we must not have, ’tis aconite, bracken, bramble
and brier, burs, burdock and cockle, duckweed and hemlock,
insane-root, nettles and opium. All these are evil
things. Let’s none of them.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Members murmur and shiver)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PORTIA: The law would call this a process of elimination.</p>

<p>ROSALIND: Madam President, I speak for the greenwood
tree, for trees are my delight. ’Twas but a while ago
that I found a man haunting the forest and abusing our
young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their bark.
Hanging odes on Hawthornes, and elegies on brambles—forsooth
deifying the name of Rosalind. I soon stopped
that.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Brave girl, what did you do?</p>

<p>ROSALIND: (laughing) I married him.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Mistress Ford, have you a thought to
add to our growing list?</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (rising and bowing low) My lady, I
thank you for your courtesy to one outside your club,
and being a good housewife I would speak for grains.
You should plant barley, corn and oats, rye and wheat.
Then too, there’s spices, ginger, nutmeg and mace—oh
yes, and mustard, thyme and savory.</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: (rising quickly) Dear Madam, I, too,
am a good housewife, pray let me speak for what we
can never neglect, good vegetables. There’s cabbage and
carrots, beans and peas, lettuce and mushrooms, and
onions, garlic and leeks.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies! Mine ears are weighted with
sounds of food. Pray let us not consider onions—garlic
and leeks—or all the perfume of Arabia will not sweeten
this little land.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Dear Madam, I fear to annoy, but would
the name of berries fall heavy on thine ear? We should
grow some of these along the bank; say blueberries and
blackberries, currants, and dewberries, gooseberries, mulberries
and strawberries, and if we grow strawberries
we must remember that our own King Henry the Fifth
hath said: “The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best, neighbored
by fruit of baser quality.” Are we humans like
that, I wonder?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (Turning to Portia) Madam Secretary,
are you able to make notes—these thoughts come
in thick and fast.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Aye, Madam, and I crave your mercy, and beg
that the quality of mercy is not strained, for Ann
Hathaway has asked that we leave not out of our discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the trees that Master Shakespeare loves so well.
If a suggestion from me comes not amiss, it would seem
wise that our members now sitting in this half circle
should try, as in our childhood games, to name the trees
in order, alphabetical, each taking her turn according to
the letter, what say you, Madam?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Most admirable. Shall we begin at
this end with Mistress Page?</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: Do I understand that I am to name
all trees I canst remember beginning with the letter ‘A?’</p>

<p>PORTIA: That is my thought, and when you have finished
just tap your neighbor and she will start with ‘B.’</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: (Thoughtfully) Almond, ash, aspen,
apple, that’s all. (taps Mistress Ford)</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: Balsam, bay, birch, box.</p>
</div>


<p class="center">(much excitement among members, all trying to think,
etc.) (Much original business)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>NEXT: Cherry, chestnut, crabapple, cypress.</p>

<p>NEXT: Elm and elder.</p>

<p>NEXT: Fig, filbert and fir.</p>

<p>NEXT: Hazlenut and holly.</p>

<p>NEXT: Lemon, lime and linden.</p>

<p>NEXT: Oak, olive, orange.</p>

<p>NEXT: Mistletoe and mulberry.</p>

<p>NEXT: Palm, peach, pear, pine, plum, pomegranate.</p>

<p>NEXT: Quince.</p>

<p>NEXT: Sycamore.</p>

<p>NEXT: Walnut and willow.</p>

<p>NEXT: Yew-tree.</p>

<p>ANN HATHAWAY: Will Shakespeare would love that
game, and thank the players, ’tis a goodly list of trees
to cast welcome shade on Avon’s banks.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, we may rest content, our
meeting hath accomplished much, is there further discussion
for our Garden Club?</p>

<p>DESDEMONA: Madam, my husband’s friend, Iago, (tho
I like nor trust him not) hath a pretty wit and hath
likened us to gardens in these words: “Our bodies are
our gardens, to which our wills are gardeners, so that if
we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop, and
weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
distract it with many, either to have it sterile with
idleness or manured with industry, why the power and
corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.” (sits down)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: True, child, very true. Ladies, let me
prophesy, that when our members have died, and worms
have eaten them and Master Shakespeare himself hath
become but ancient history—garden clubs in times to
come will remember fair Avon’s shores made lovely by
your sweet suggestions.</p>

<p>CLEOPATRA: (languidly) Madam, I move we adjourn.</p>
